Freecodecamp project.

Uses Wikipedia.org API to search user's input, fetches 10 results initially and continue fetching 10 results at a time
everytime user hits bottom of page.

I enjoyed playing around with the different API responses, and learned how $.ajax() works.

Minimalistic design as I feel that's what a search page should feel like.
